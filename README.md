# My Personal Site

This is my personal portfolio site. If you want to see the live version you can find it [here](https://evanrodrigues.net).

## Development

I used a [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) template to get the site started. Everything else is developed with ClojureScript, [reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent), and CSS.

## Dependencies

-   [secretary](https://github.com/clj-commons/secretary): Used to set up client-side routing.

## Purpose

The purpose of this site is to provide an easy way for potential employers to view my projects and learn a little more about me. The site provides a clean and simple way to view my work and contact me.

## Future Plans

* Add a contact form.
* Add small animations.
* Split up portfolio into two sections (projects and professional work).
* Maybe add a blog to share my thoughts on anything I've learned.
