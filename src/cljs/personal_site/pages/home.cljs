   [:p "I'm a Software Developer, who loves to develop web applications. I have experience in all aspects of the software lifecycle from design through development, implementation, and documentation. I also have experience working independently and in a team environment. Along with creating websites, I enjoy developing applications for streamers to use on Twitch.tv in my free time. I've used the platform for years, so a lot of my inspiration for personal projects stems from video games and live streaming."]])
